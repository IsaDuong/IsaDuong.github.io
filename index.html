                            	<p>The Jacobiac-Isomatronic 69 (JI-69) is a scientific calculator made using Python and Tkinter. It comes with many mathematical functions, including:</p>
                            	<ul><li>Addition</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Subtraction</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Multiplication</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Division</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Factoring</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Trigonometric Functions</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Combinations and Permutations</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Series Listing</li></ul>
								<ul><li>Polygonal and Polyhedral Numbers</li></ul>
								<ul><li>not graphing :( </li></ul>

                            	<p>The process of coding for this calculator was split between Jacob and I. Jacob was in charge of the #NastyMaths portion, which accomplished putting key presses on the screen and making them interact with each other correctly.</p>
                            	<p>I was responsible for the graphics portion of this product, where I developed the design and GUIs that were linked to Jacob's controls.</p>
 
                            	<h4 style="text-align:center">Issues with Coding</h4>
                            	<p>The greatest struggle I experienced while coding this product was probably planning the design. We had originally intended the product to be a graphing calculator, but had to cut down to a scientific calculator due to time limitations. We encountered issues with buttons, involving not only the plotting of over 100 coordinate points, but making sure that these points were perfectly aligned and working. There was a time when I received an error saying that I had an error in my code in line 2956 (my code was only 39 lines long at the time). It terrified me and I reviewed my code 3 times before noticing that I had forgotten a coordinate among the disgusting plethora of them. </p>
