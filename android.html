<h2>Game Description</h2>
	<p>The program Forrest and I will be making is called “Fedora Tipper”. It is a Cookie Clicker inspired game made using MIT App Inventor 2.
The purpose of this game is to achieve euphoria, a state only attained through the acquisition of 69,420,666 tips. Once euphoria has been attained, the game is reset. Players may purchase upgrades (Tipper, Neckbeard, Fedora Trick, Le Tip, M’lady?) to increase tip production. These upgrades will increase the total number of tips over time. BASICALLY THIS GAME IS LIKE COOKIE CLICKER.</p>
<h2>Reflections</h2>
	<p>The hardest part of setting up this game was probably the clocks. Which is why I made Forrest do it. It was, however, tedious to get all of the labels and buttons placed on the screen. Another problem encountered was looking for tiny errors in the code (Ex:  incorrect value that affected whole game)</p>
